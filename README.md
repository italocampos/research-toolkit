# Research toolkit

This repository contains two auxiliary methods that compound my master's
research application: a **Tabu Search** and a **Brute Force** algorithms, both
applied to the electric network reconfiguration problem.


## Dependencies

This repository depends on some other Python modules. Below I listed these
dependencies:

- [Pandapower](http://www.pandapower.org/);
- [Color lib](https://github.com/italocampos/color);
- [Graph](https://github.com/italocampos/graphs) (in the adjacency matrix
form);

To run the features of this repository, install the modules above in your
Python env.


## Tabu Search

The Tabu Search is modeled according the constraints and criterias defined in
my master's research. To know how they work, refer to my master's thesis
(Brazilian portuguese only).


### Running the Tabu Search

## Brute Force algorithm

The Brute Force algorithm aims to list the optimal solutions of the choosed
scenario. To keenly know how it works, refer to my master's thesis (Brazilian
portuguese only).
